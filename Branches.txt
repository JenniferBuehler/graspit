abstract_ivmgr  locale_compatibility    windows_install ?

    abstract_ivmgr_locale_compatibility  - merge of others, added changes in body and world
        new_master_in_dev  - added changes in EGPlanner and the cmake files (and one small change in searchState.h, searchEnergy.h, simAnn.h about in the #include matvec) to build the new master

all other branches are old rubbish
